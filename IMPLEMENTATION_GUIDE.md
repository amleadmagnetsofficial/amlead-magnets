# AmLead Google Ads Compliance Guide
## Implementation & Maintenance Notes

---

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### 1. Phone Greeting (Non-Negotiable)
When customers call (888) 314-0268, they MUST hear:
> "Thank you for calling AmLead, an independent service assistance platform."

This greeting is documented in:
- Contact page (contact.html)
- Refund Policy (refund-policy.html)
- FAQ questions (index.html)
- Terms & Conditions (terms-conditions.html)

**Why:** Google Ads auditors will test phone verification. This greeting proves independence.

---

### 2. Disclosure Requirements

All disclosures must appear in these locations:

**Homepage (index.html):**
- Yellow/Gold compliance banner above hero section (ABOVE THE FOLD)
- Footer disclosure

**Every Other Page:**
- Footer disclosure on all pages
- Additional context in body where relevant

**Legal Pages (Privacy, Terms, Refund, Disclaimer):**
- Blue disclosure box at top after header
- Integrated language throughout sections
- Footer disclosure

---

### 3. Refund Policy - THE MOST IMPORTANT PAGE

Google Ads REQUIRES clear refund eligibility. This page has:

✅ **7-15 day window** (prominently stated in Section 1)
✅ **Eligibility criteria** (Section 2 - critical)
✅ **Non-refundable items** (listed clearly)
✅ **Processing timeline** (7-14 business days)
✅ **Safe wording** ("may be submitted... subject to...")

**Never say:**
- "Full refund guaranteed"
- "No questions asked refunds"
- "Unconditional refund"

**Always say:**
- "May be submitted within 7-15 days, subject to..."
- "Eligibility depends on service type and delivery"

---

### 4. Language Compliance Quick Reference

**USE THESE WORDS:**
- Assist, assistance, aid
- Guide, guidance, help, support
- Facilitate, facilitate, connect
- Recommend, suggest
- Information, educational
- Platform, service

**NEVER USE:**
- Buy, purchase, order
- Official, authorized
- Best, cheapest, lowest
- Guaranteed
- Sell, provider (except when naming actual providers)
- Activate, install (except in provider context)

---

### 5. Provider References

**When mentioning providers (AT&T®, Verizon®, etc.):**

**DO:**
- Include ™ or ® after every mention first time per page
- Say "reference" or "for informational purposes"
- Use phrases like "We guide customers interested in..."
- State "no affiliation"

**DON'T:**
- Imply partnership or official status
- Use their brand colors/styling
- Suggest you represent them
- Claim authorization

**Example (CORRECT):**
> "We provide guidance about AT&T® fiber internet, helping customers understand speeds and availability in their area. This is informational support only—we have no affiliation with AT&T®."

**Example (WRONG):**
> "AT&T® partners with us to deliver premium fiber services."
